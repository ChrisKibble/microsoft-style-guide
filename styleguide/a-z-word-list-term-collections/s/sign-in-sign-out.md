# sign in, sign out

Use *sign in*
to describe starting a session on a computer, a device, a network, an
app, or anywhere a username and password are required. Use *sign out* to refer to ending a session. 

Don't use *log in, login, log onto, log off of, log out, logout, signin, signoff, sign off,* or *sign on* unless these terms appear in the UI (and you're writing instructions).

The verb form is two words, *sign in* or *sign out.* Avoid using as a noun or adjective (*sign-in, sign-out*). Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do.

**Examples**  
Enter your password to sign in.  
Some networks can be set up to remember your username and password.  
After an extended period without activity, the network will sign you out automatically.
